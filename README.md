This code is a very basic code that allows to replicate and reproduce the graphs in Narisano and Bagli (2025) paper on the direct objects of the verbs to taste and to smell in English. 
The code selects the relevant data from a dataset, creates two histograms (one for each verb) and a final wordcloud showing common direct objects.
